## Description

This repository is a lab created as a personal laboratory. This open-source project focuses on creating vulnerable and poorly developed environments for security and hacking practices for beginners. The user must create their own hacking tools.

**WARNING**: Do not use these tools for illicit or illegal purposes. Ethical use and prior consent are fundamental in any security-related activity.

---
## Supported Platforms

This process requires an environment with Python 3 or higher installed and can be run through an IDE or the terminal. I recommend using an IDE like VS Code for optimal performance.

- **Linux** (Recommended).
- **Windows** (CMD/PowerShell/WSL).

### Installation and Execution

You can download the tools individually via releases or clone the repository:

```Shell
git clone https://github.com/S-k-i-f/vulnLab-security-sandbox.git
cd vulnLab-security-sandbox
python website_vuln.py
```
